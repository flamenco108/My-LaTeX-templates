## ereader-template
(2015) Template to create nice PDF's to read them on ebook-reader. Fitted to Kindle, as I have one.
(2021) In fact I don't have a Kindle anymore. Lately I use anything what reads EPUBs, as this format is easy editable. But this template creates just PDFs just for 6 inches display, so it works on any ereader.

Projecting this template I assumed, that the display should be used for display text, not margins. But you can easily adjust it for your needs.
